This is a user manual for the code SiDE4BNCT.
(Revised on 30th March 2022)

The SiDE4BNCT is composed of following three main codes:
  1) 001_tab.cpp
  2) 002_calc.cpp
  3) 003_ad.py

[ 001_tab.cpp ]
This code computes the DPF table data.
The code is prepared for each of neutron and primary gamma-ray.
The radiobiological coefficients, such as RBE, CBE and kerma, are defined here.

[ 002_calc.cpp ]
This code computes the dose rate distribution in the phantom.
The code is prepared for each of neutron and primary gamma-ray.
Input energy spectra are needed to be specified here.
The input spectrum file should be located in the "spectra" directory.
Please rewrite the file name of the input spectrum and output distribution. 
For example, the file names of input and output are defined at line 230 and 197, respectively.

[ 003_ad.py ]
This code computes the dose distribution and dose indexes.
The dose restrictions to compute the dose distribution can be given arbitrarily.
The restriction items are mucosa dose, skin dose, and the other normal tissue dose.

!!! CAUTION !!!
Above codes are offered as zip files here.
These zip files includes the main codes and a part of other items only.
The energy spectra in the phantom for monoenergetic neutron and gamma-ray should be loaded in the "PHITSresults" directory.
So please contact us or prepare them by yourself before use.
